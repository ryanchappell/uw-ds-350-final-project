2016-05-30 15:46:00 INFO::#### Summary for hypothesis /r/aww on the front page:
#- H0 /r/aww composes less than 10% of the subreddits on the front page
#- Ha /r/aww composes 10% or more of the subreddits on the front page
Of 500 samples of the samples reddit front page (100 posts each sample) from 2016-05-13 10:36:01 to 2016-05-23 19:45:46, the aww subreddit makes up 4.62% of the subreddits on the front page. In order to confirm statistical significance of the sample, I tested it against a Poisson distribution. The p-value for /r/aww making up 4.62% of the subreddits on the front page is 0.00801431319973434. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
