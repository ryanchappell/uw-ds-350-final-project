2016-05-30 15:44:58 INFO::#### Summary:
## To get a good fit with SVD, we looked at a linear regression of the AIC for 2 to n number of features to find the number of features (or, principal components) with the lowest AIC. The point at which the AIC is minimum is 50 features.
## To compare the variance explained by the full model and the model generated by finding the SVD model with the minimum AIC, we can look at the adjusted R-squared. The adjusted R-squared for the full model is 0.0630533578344608. The adjusted R-squared for the SVD model with minimum AIC is 0.0612133913620859.
